WWW-Selenium-Utils
==================

This package contains useful helper libraries and scripts for 
testing websites using Selenium.

  http://selenium.thoughtworks.com

The selenium-regen script can be used to automatically convert test scripts
written in a simple wiki-like table markup into the html tables that Selenium
expects.

Sample .wiki file:

  Test Title
  | open | /foo |
  | verifyLocation | /foo | 
  | verifyTextPresent | id=name | Luke |
  # Comments are allowed

  # Blank lines are allowed too
  | clickAndWait | id=main_btn |

  # And you can include other files!  Exciting!
  include "other_file.tmpl"

This package contains two modules:

  WWW::Selenium::Utils
    generate_suite() - converts wiki files, creates TestSuite.html

  WWW::Selenium::Utils::CGI
    run() - runs a command, returns the output
    cat() - dump the contents of a file
    state() - query and store simple key/value pairs to keep state

    You will need to wrap these functions in CGI or mod_perl handlers.
    Example scripts can be found in the scripts/ directory.
    
And some example scripts:

  script/postResults.cgi - writes a Selenium result post to disk
